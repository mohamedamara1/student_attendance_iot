# Student Attendance System

A comprehensive Student Attendance System implemented with ESP32 microcontroller, SQLite database, ArduinoJSON, React.js, and more.

## Project Structure

- `230422-132518-esp32dev`: PlatformIO project folder. This folder contains the ESP32 microcontroller code and configurations.
- `react_front`: This directory holds the React.js front-end for the attendance system. You can find the user interface and related files here.
- `attendance_db.db`: SQLite database file where student attendance records are stored.

## Usage

- Access the React.js front-end to view and manage student attendance records.
- The ESP32 microcontroller handles the backend logic, data storage, and API endpoints for the system.
